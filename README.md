# Basic description of this project

Result of finishing this project should be an auction website like [ebay](https://ebay.com) or [allegro](https://allegro.pl). All users should be able to buy, sell, search for and watch products listed on this website by other users. All listings should be divided into categories and subcategories and those should in an accurate way describe contained in them products. One listing should be contained in only one category and subcategory (which is related to category). Users can order products from multiple sellers (which are also users of in a meaning of an architecture of this software) to multiple saved locations/addresses. Users can save listings to a watchlist in case they want to come back to them later.
